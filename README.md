# **Risso's Dolphin Echolocation Research**

## **Overview**
This research studies Risso’s dolphins (*Grampus griseus*) throughout the California Current, using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) to uncover how they communicate, behave, and respond to changing ocean environments. This work supports both scientific discovery and responsible offshore wind energy development.

## **Objectives**
- **Population Boundaries**: Identify whether distinct dolphin subpopulations exist in this region.
- **Vocalization Patterns**: Analyze echolocation click characteristics via spectrograms and long-term spectral averages.
- **Geographic Variation**: Compare data from central Oregon to central California, as well as the US East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and Hawaii.
- **Conservation & Management**: Help inform strategies that protect dolphins while balancing energy and economic needs.

## **Data Collection**
- **Survey Range**: Primarily central Oregon to central California.
- **Recording Method**: Drifting or moored acoustic recorders capturing continuous, high-resolution audio.
- **Time Frame**: Multiple deployments from 2016 through 2023, covering different seasons.

## **Methodology**
1. **Detection**: Identify Risso’s dolphins using established signal classification tools (e.g., “PAMpal” in R).  
2. **Spectral Analysis**: Extract peak frequencies and notch frequencies for each click.  
3. **Regional Comparisons**: Use statistical tests (ANOVA, clustering) to see how echolocation might vary by location or time.

## **Importance**
- **Ecological Insight**: Shed light on how these deep-diving dolphins use echolocation and adapt to changing ocean dynamics.  
- **Offshore Wind**: Provide baseline data for evaluating impacts of new wind energy projects.  
- **Informed Conservation**: Support better management of Risso’s dolphins under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and related guidelines.

## **Potential Biases**
- **Patchy Coverage**: Some parts of the California Current remain under-sampled.  
- **Environmental Noise**: Wind, weather, and recorder depth might influence detection quality.  
- **Classification Errors**: Automated and manual analyses can introduce misclassifications.
